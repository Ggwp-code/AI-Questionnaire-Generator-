          "answer": "Choose Subtree B (4 leaves). It has the lowest validation error (0.07), indicating the best generalization on the held-out validation set; although its training error (0.08) is higher than the full tree, that suggests pruning reduced overfitting and improved out-of-sample performance.",
          "explanation": "Reasoning:\n- Use validation error to select among pruned subtrees because it estimates out-of-sample performance.\n- Subtree B has the lowest validation error (0.07), so it best balances fit and generalization.\n- The higher training error relative to the full tree indicates pruning reduced overfitting; B keeps model complexity low (4 leaves) while achieving the best validation performance.\nAdditional note: If validation errors were very close, prefer the simpler model or confirm choice on an independent test set.",
