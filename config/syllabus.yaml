# Validation Settings
validation:
  # Similarity threshold for fuzzy matching (0.0 to 1.0)
  # Higher = stricter matching
  similarity_threshold: 0.6

  # Stricter threshold for high-Bloom questions (level 5-6)
  strict_threshold: 0.8

  # Allow partial word matches
  allow_partial_matches: true

  # Maximum regeneration attempts (Guardian allows ONE retry)
  max_regenerations: 1
